##open analysis object the easy way
directory = r'D:\Data\Chi_data\first data\output2\Run00002'
#(optional) You can check what is there analyzed in the folder with .validate()
plc.Single_tracked_folder(directory).validate()
# use .open_files() to open the analysis object
image1 = plc.Single_tracked_folder(directory).open_files()

#%%
##To plot, first explore interesting tracks. For that I would use the stats files:
ch0_stats = image1.stats0
ch1_stats = image1.stats1
coloc_stats = image1.coloc_stats
#%%
# now you can use the variable explorer of Spyder to get the track ID (or coloc track ID) of the track or tracks you want to plot. 
# The stats are open in a pd.DataFrame, so you cna always use your standard operation to filter track IDs as you want in  an automatic manner. 
# once you have the track or tarcks you want to plot you can plot them on top of an image (pass the tracks in a list!):   
image1.plot_tracks([1704], channel= 'ch0') #in here we plot from channel0 (the reference channel for colocalizing) the track number 1704.
image1.plot_tracks([2513], channel= 'ch1') # track 2513 for channel 1. 
image1.plot_colocs([248]) #in here we plot the coloc track (track in ch0, track in ch1, and coloc track on top of the reference channel image)
#%%
##To save any of the images or plots generated:
# image1.plot_colocs([248]).save_plot('path', dpi = 300)
##or in case you want to edit it more, or the result is not a single plot (a df and a plot for example)
#plot = image1.plot_colocs([248])
#plot.save_plot('path', dpi = 300)
#%%
image1.intensity_coloc(470, 'upper left', 'CD19', 'Zap70') #in here we plot the intensities over time of a coloc track. We pass the track ID (not in a list now!)
                                                            # then as optional we can pass the location of the legend, and the labels for ch0 and ch1.
                                                            
# TODO: #I still have to implement intensity plotting for a single channel (for one or multiple tracks)

#%%
#there is also the option to extract the diffusion coefficients. I will also implement extratcing dwell times in the future. Upon request, I
#can implement more data extraction. 
d = image1.extract_Ds(10, 'ch0')

#%%
#We also have operations for full datsets. For this, we first create a folder (the one we pass) and inside it we make subfolders named by the 
#condition. For example, in Chi's case it has 4 folders: CART3-HighExp, CART3-LowExp, CART4-HighExp, CART4-LowExp. Even if you only have one condition, 
#please, make a single subfolder 
#We set the object as:
a = plc.Dataset_tracked_folder(r'D:\Data\Chi_data\20250414\to_track')
#%%
#We can get the parameters used to colocalize the dataset with
a.validate()

#%%
#we can select if we only want to work with a subset of the conditions. Migth be sometimes interesting to analyze only a subset of the data. 
a.select_conditions([0, 1])
#%%
#We can count the number of colocalized tracks. 
counting = a.count_number_cotracks()
#we can also aggregate the counting per condition. 
summary_counting = a.summary_count_number_cotracks()
#%%
#we can check which runs have colocalized tracks. If we have selected conditions, it will only do it for the selected ones. 
a.count_cotracked()
tracked_folders = a.tracked_folders
#%%
#We can extract the diffusion coefficients with ROI, condition, and folder for one or he other channel 
Ds_df, box = a.get_Ds(min_len=0, channel = 'ch1')
# I am currently working on extracting the diffusion coefficients of each run and have it saved per ROI and condition. The same for dwell times. 
# Let me know of any other request.   
#%%
#We can also extract the dwell times. For that we pass a minimum length of the colocalized track and a reference channel. 
#The reference channel is the channel which has first a track and then the track from the other channel joins. 
#The code outputs a histogram. The bars will be half transparent so we see all histograms. But we can reorder the histogram 
#from back to fron using .select_conditions. 
a.select_conditions([1, 0, 3,2])
dwell_df, hist = a.get_dwell(min_len = 10, ref = 'ch0')
#%%
#after generating the plot, you can modify it and save it. For example:
hist.set_xlim(0, 120)
hist.save_plot(r'C:\Users\castrolinares\Data analysis\hist.pdf', dpi = 300)
